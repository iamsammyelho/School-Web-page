# School-Web-page
A web page for a school website 
the HTM and CSS files handles the front end of the web page 
while the JavaScript simply handles the toggle bar action and the navigation bar 

Would like to implemt a sign up page as well and a log in page as well as user id number generation 

NOTE the code is not perfect
